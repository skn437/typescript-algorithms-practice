This project is also fully configured for [Jest](https://jestjs.io) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com). Learn more from official Jest [Documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) and official React Testing Library [Documentation](https://testing-library.com/docs/). This is for Unit Testing.

This is useful for Git Hooks. You can use it to lint your commit messages, run tests, lint code, etc... when you commit or push.

This project is also fully configured for [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com).

## Run Tests

```bash
## For Jest Test (Unit and Integration Test) With Watch Flag
pnpm test

## For Cypress Test (End-to-End and Integration Test)
pnpm e2e
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
